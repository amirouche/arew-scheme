### `(entangle-continue entangle milliseconds)`

Wait for events registred with `ENTANGLE` for
`MILLISECONDS`. `entangle-continue` will call the continuations
registred with `entangle-register-read!` and
`entangle-register-write!` according to every file descriptor type of
readyness.

`MILLISECONDS` is a timeout:

- If there is no file descriptor ready
after `MILLISECONDS`, `entangle-continue` will return.

- When `MILLISECONDS` is `-1`, `entangle-continue` will passively
block indefinitly.

- When `MILLISECONDS` is zero, `entangle-continue` will not wait and
will exec the continuations for the file descriptor that are already
ready at the moment of the call.

A `timeout` bigger than zero, does not mean that `entangle-continue`
will necessarly return after `timeout`, it may return
sooner.

`entangle-continue` will block passively until either:

- one or more file descriptors are ready;
- the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or
- the timeout expires.

> **Note:** Usually you should set the timeout so that,
> `entangle-continue` returns so that the event-loop may have a chance
> to execute some code that is scheduled at a fixed time. Otherwise,
> when the event-loop has nothing else to do but network input/output,
> timeout should be `-1`.
